## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Hedgehog or later
- Android SDK 24 (minimum) / SDK 34 (target)
- OpenAI API key

### OpenAI API Key Setup

To use the application, you need to configure your OpenAI API key.

#### Steps to configure your API key:

1. **Get your OpenAI API key:**
   - Go to [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Sign in or create an account
   - Create a new API key

2. **Configure the API key in the project:**
   - Open the `local.properties` file in the project root
   - Add the following line at the end of the file:
   ```properties
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```
   - Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual OpenAI API key

3. **Sync the project:**
   - In Android Studio, click "Sync Now" or manually sync
   - Build the project

#### Example of local.properties:

```properties
sdk.dir=/Users/your-username/Library/Android/sdk
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

#### Important:

- **DO NOT** share your API key publicly
- **DO NOT** commit the `local.properties` file to the repository
- The `local.properties` file is in `.gitignore` by default

## 🤖 Available Models

By default, the app uses the `gpt-4o-mini` model, but you can change it in `OpenAIDataSource.kt` to other models such as:

- `gpt-3.5-turbo`
- `gpt-4`
- `gpt-4-turbo-preview`
- Other models available in the OpenAI documentation

To change the model, locate the following line in `OpenAIDataSource.kt`:

```kotlin
model = ModelId("gpt-4o-mini")
```
